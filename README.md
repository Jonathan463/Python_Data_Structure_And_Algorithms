# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my personal progress, notes, and code as I learn and practice **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Python**. The goal is to build a solid foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking for technical interviews and real-world software engineering.

---

## What You'll Find Here

* ✅ Implementations of common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, etc.)
* ✅ Classic and advanced algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, backtracking, greedy, etc.)
* ✅ Solved problems from popular platforms (Leetcode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.)
* ✅ Well-commented Python code and occasional explanations
* ✅ Time and space complexity analysis

## ⚙️ Requirements

You only need Python 3.x. Optionally:

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Build deep intuition for core data structures
* Master algorithms used in competitive coding and interviews
* Practice clean code and documentation
* Track progress and reflect on learning journey
